This report mainly deals with designing inter-procedural heap reference analysis for concurrent programs in Java. The analysis is both flow-sensitive and context-sensitive at the inter-procedural level. Heap Reference analysis determines a collection of objects pointed to by program variables or their fields. Java implements pointers by references. This report also discusses about analysis techniques for concurrent programs at intra-procedural level and about extending analysis to inter-procedural level using the VASCO tool.
