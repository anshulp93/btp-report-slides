\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this report the topics covered are : 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The mechanism of Heap reference analysis using points-to and live variable analysis on access paths. It is necessary to store the access path values at a statement as an access graph to keep the data fact bounded.
	\item The method of value context used to carry out precise inter-procedural analysis with an example case on handling recursion.
	\item The technique of constructing sync-cfg for performing intra-procedural data flow analysis of concurrent programs.
	\item The extension of concurrent analysis to an inter-procedural level, by using VASCO for generating call-graph and designing inter-procedural analysis.
\end{itemize}

The future work to be done is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementation of CombinedUnitGraph class to handle programs with more than 2 threads.
	\item Using Value context method of performing inter-procedural analysis on data-race free concurrent programs containing function calls.
	\item Implementing Heap reference analysis on concurrent programs containing function calls.
\end{itemize}
